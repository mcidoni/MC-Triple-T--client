## TIC TAC TOE: An interactive game ages 1+

Thank you for playing my Tic Tac Toe game! I see you've found the README... 
For my game, I wanted to design a UI that was clean, easy to navigate, and above all fun. Simply put, this is 
my take on the ages old game we all know and play when our phones are dead...

## PLANNING STORY: 

When I was first tasked with creating a tic-tac-toe game, I did not realize how complex it would be to create such a simple game using code. I started by making a wireframe of what I thought the game board should look like, although as my coding progessed, so did the look of the game. I stuck with a modern, minimal look for styling, and went with a color scheme that was vibrant, yet easy on the eyes. I started by working on my HTML so I could have the foundation on which I could interact with using JS and JQuery. Once i was satisfied with that, I moved on to the CSS aspect of the project, just making enough tweaks so that my eyes were happy with what I was looking at while I was programming the bulk of the JavaScript. And as you may have guessed, I moved on to the JavaScript once I was done with basic styling. 

## USER STORIES:

As a user, I want to create a game account
As a user, I want to play intuitively 
As a user, I want to track my games played
As a user, I want to be able to change my password

## Technologies Used: 
- JavaScript
- JQuery
- HTML
- CSS (including SASS and FlexBox)

## Unsolved Problems:

- I would still like to make my code a bit DRYer
- Figure out more intuitive game logic with less code
- Refactor as needed to keep things running efficiently and bug-free
